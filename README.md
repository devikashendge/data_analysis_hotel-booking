# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing hotel booking data** to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help understand customer behavior, booking cancellations, seasonal demand, and revenue-related factors. The analysis is performed using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

The goal is to demonstrate practical **data analysis skills** such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight generation — aligned with real-world analytics tasks.
